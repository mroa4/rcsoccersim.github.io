The RoboCup Soccer Simulation 2D League is a global competition within RoboCup that focuses on simulating soccer matches in a 2D environment, showcasing advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics. Each year, teams from across the world participate, presenting their research and innovations.

Steps to Participate
Develop Your Team
You can either build your team from scratch or start with an existing base and enhance it with unique strategies, algorithms, and tactics.

Prepare a Team Description Paper (TDP)
Your TDP should detail your team’s architecture, algorithms, and strategic approach. This document is essential for the qualification process.

Stay Updated on the Call for Participation
The organizing committee typically publishes a call for participation on the league's website and mailing list around the end of the year, with the tournament taking place in the summer of the following year.

Submit Your TDP by the Deadline
Submit your TDP to the league committee before the specified deadline to enter the qualification phase. The committee will review and provide feedback on each TDP, selecting the top teams to advance.

Register and Compete
If your team qualifies, complete the registration process to secure your place in the competition.

Through these steps, you’ll be well-prepared to join the RoboCup Soccer Simulation 2D League and compete on a global stage.
